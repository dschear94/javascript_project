## Background and Overview

### Motivation for project

I am passionate about music.


Growing up, I can remember listening to classic rock on the radio in the car with my parents and sisters.
These experiences were foundational to my love of music.
In many ways, music led me into software development. 
The opportunity to combine music and coding to create something special for listeners is a beautiful opprtunity to marry my technical abilities with passion. 

### High level overview

I plan to use a variety of web technologies to construct an audio visualization program.
Users will be able to select what they want to listen to, and how they want to see it represented visually, using a variety of selected parameters.
